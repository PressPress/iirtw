					<span class="interview2">Kimi Hanauer:</span> <span class="interview1">What are five things you say absolutely 100% yes to?</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					Bryanna Jenkins: 
					<br>
					1. Treating myself to heels.
					<br>
					2. Traveling.
					<br>
					3. Eating delicious food.
					<br>
					4. Encouraging other trans women in their successes.
					<br>
					5. Binging on good television shows.
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">In a video online, while speaking about following your dreams you said, “You have to fight for your right to dream. Fight for your right to be great.” What does it mean to fight for your right to dream? What is the power behind and the risk of dreaming for something? 
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					BJ: Fighting for your right to dream to me looks like eliminating negativity and negative people from my inner circle. It means taking risks to advance myself even when I am unsure of how things will pan out or the lack of confidence that I experience in seeing my dream to its fruition. The greatest power behind following my dreams is that I am in control of the narrative that I put out to the world.
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">What does it mean to be free? Is there a moment that you can share that you felt a strong sense of freedom? 
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					BJ: Freedom for me is being in relationship with myself. Freedom for me is me reclaiming my spirituality. Freedom for me is owning my truth and telling my own narrative. My strongest sense of freedom occurred when I began the journey of my transition. I knew that I was on a path that would ultimately lead to me learning to love all the things I liked, loved, hated, or found questionable about my life and lived experiences.
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">Being a public figure is also like being a target. How do you protect and take care of yourself in difficult situations while also navigating your position as a strong leader and role model for so many? 
					</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					BJ: I surround myself with people that love and care for me and ones that have consistently demonstrated friendship and loyalty to me. I also give myself permission to step away from activism and focus on different passions that fulfill me as a person. I love listening to music and I love traveling to new places and enthralling myself in the culture of the location.

					<span class="interview3">BJ:</span><span class="interview1"> I feel like some kids, you can see they have a commitment to themselves to do better, to be excellent in whatever they do. It’s really cool to see that in young kids.</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: We had a student who really broke the mold at Patterson High School—who was the salutatorian, spoke at graduation, and went on to a four year college. He really inspired other kids, like, hey I can do that too, and two years later, another RYP student became the valedictorian.
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview3">BJ:</span><span class="interview1"> RYP is really a space for people to motivate one another. Just in general, I’m really amazed by how they help each other learn something and there’s really no shame. Is it difficult to work with so many different sites? They probably all pose slightly different challenges? </span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: The sites are so different—one consistent thing we do is really trying to create this safe space where everyone feels like they can make mistakes and learn at their own pace. The catch with having so many different after school program sites is that the need is so different. High school and middle school students need more support with employment training, homework, and college prep. Probably the biggest difference is also the age range, the K-5th kids need so much more structure, plus there’s like 90 of them in one room! We also try and integrate community arts into all three sites to meet the emotional and social needs of students.
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">How has your art background affected or prepared you for this type of work? </span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: I think the biggest way that my background has affected my job at RYP is just basically the foundations I learned from community arts. I think for me, as a trained illustrator, I really focus on the craft and technique itself. After graduating from MICA with an MFA in Community Arts, my practice and beliefs changed. As a facilitator, I still believe technique is important but it’s not as important as the process that takes place during art-making. And so, if there’s a dialogue that takes place that changes the way a student views the world or another person, then most often, that change is more important than that end product created. I think using art as a tool to bridge cultural differences or explore challenges is a perfect fit.

					<span class="bold">There’s so many ways to use art creatively to tackle some of the challenges that they are going through, weather it is bullying, discrimination, identity issues, conflict resolution...</span>

				<p class="ch-interview">
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">One thing Bomin and I have been talking about is trying to create a space where individuals in the group feel free to envision the world they want, say whatever they want and use the language that they want to use. And that’s definitely something we sense more broadly in the atmosphere at RYP.</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: I think there’s so many ways to use art creatively to tackle some of the challenges that they are going through, weather it is bullying, discrimination, identity issues, conflict resolution, any of that coming all the way down to just expression or language itself. Art has really become RYP’s universal language. Through the process of expression, it doesn’t matter what their level of English is, but through the process of expression, we can have this alternative way of communicating with one another. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">There’s so much potential for ESOL  (English for Speakers of Other Languages) education and the experience of learning English to be an alienating experience, but at RYP it’s really prevalent that that’s not happening, as far as I can tell. You work in a reflexive way, responding to specific needs and having to change the structure as different needs become more prevalent… </span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: One thing we have been asking ourselves is if we are an educational program that has these other components, or if we should become a completely arts-based organization? And I think right now, since English and homework help is such a big part of what we do, we will always be education-based. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Honestly, sometime in the near future I will probably be leaving RYP. Someone with a bigger vision or new skill set will take what I have established and make it even better. That’s a beautiful thing. When I accepted the job, I was so excited to hit the ground running to implement new programs. My hope is that someone else with new ideas can take it even farther.
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">What would you say are a few of the elements that make for meaningful education? </span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: A lot of ESOL teachers have amazingly big hearts and are willing to go above and beyond to do things for their students. I mean, they bring the students clothing, food, assist with finding community resources, shelter and more. 
					<br>
					<br>
					Having a safe space to appreciate and celebrate diversity is really important. I think finding relevant topics to the youth, and making subject matter student-centered and engaging is also important. Energy and enthusiasm has to be really high! 
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview3">BJ:</span> <span class="interview1"> In order to be consistent and to be grounded, you have to constantly be responsive to whatever is happening in the city or with the places the youth come from. How do you keep yourself grounded personally? </span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: Occasionally, I take a break from my normal RYP duties and lead relevant workshops for the youth. I think finding a way to overlap my passion in developing those workshops or giving the youth a platform to raise their voice helps keep me grounded. 
					<br>
					<br>
					When the media exploded with images of the refugee crisis and the debate began, some our students really took a hit because of their religion or their backgrounds. So instead of isolating that population to do a project, we facilitated a bigger conversation with a larger group of high school students. After small group discussion, they designed t-shirts that were more about inclusion for everyone; the design had a circle with a peace sign in it saying culture and knowledge, culture is knowledge and knowledge is culture. One student was really adamant about keeping get to know people and he just kept saying, you just have to get to know people. He spoke about people withholding judgment and forming relationships. They are incredible humans and I was thrilled to be part of a powerful moment. I think that kind of work, even though it is outside of the scope of things I should be doing, is really what keeps me going. I think when you know that your meeting a community need but also doing something you really love—it’s not really work.

				<p class="ch-interview">
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">How do you deal with cultural tensions within the program itself?</span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: When we started our Moravia site, we were so excited to have this new program, but what we didn’t realize is that there would be as much conflict within our own space. It was kind of a wake up call for us to realize that when you combine 20 different populations, you still need to give them that space to get to know each other. Helping them understand that their stories are unique, but that they also have commonalities, helped build empathy and understanding. Also, RYP has over 250 dedicated volunteers each year. They play a crucial role in welcoming, supporting and teaching our youth as well. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview2">KH:</span> <span class="interview1">What do you think an artist’s role could be within creating social change or whatever it is that needs to happen? </span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: I think first and foremost, the artist should respect the community’s needs and make sure that your agenda is completely aligned with theirs. I also think of the artist as more of a facilitator. They are there to ask questions and generate information and ideas from the community. Part of their role to be there to provide expertise in technique, while using it to lift up and highlight the community’s voice. 
					<br>
					<br>
					<span class="interview3">BJ:</span> <span class="interview1"> Last question… What would you do if you ruled the world? What would ruling be and what kind of world would it be? </span>
					<br>
					<br>
					KP: If I ruled the world, I would wave a magic wand and spread a little more empathy. Living in a more compassionate and empathetic world would be ideal for me. Thinking about a recent trip to Cuba, I know things don’t have to be “beautiful” to be good. I think being open and accepting, promoting empathy and understanding of the good, the bad, and the ugly… is number one. And gosh, more equality!! I really agree with a lot of the things our youth wrote in that manifesto. They are brilliant!
