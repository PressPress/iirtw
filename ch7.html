					<p class="bzk-interview">
						<span class="interview1">Kimi Hanauer: What are a few things you say 100% yes to?</span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						Besan Khamis: Colors, Black power, and 110% YES to rolled grape leaves. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="interview1">KH: Amazing. I saw you using this phrase online, so I wanted to ask, what is your vision of an artistic Palestinian intifada?</span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						BK: I think, first of all, this is just inherent to resistance: everyone says 100% NO to occupation. Not everyone is an artist, but everyone under occupation is creative in some way. So an artistic intifada demands change through being creative and embraces art as a medium for change. I think art can be used as a representation for people’s own infinite possibility as humans. Over there, people have accepted that art can be therapeutic, but I think people need to embrace art as something that’s more than that, something that’s valuable in and of itself. I believe in resistance on all fronts, but I do want to push art as another viable resistance medium.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="interview1">KH: So what do you think is the importance of metaphor and imagination within the conflict? Is it important at all?</span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						BK: Yeah, it totally is. I think that symbols and metaphor are omnipresent in that land… like walls, guns, keys, the kufiyya, birds… they all enter in and out of the land of metaphor and reality. Walls exist in real life but then they are used in metaphor interchangeably. And then symbols are everywhere. They also get misused and mistreated. For example, if an Israeli flag, with a Star of David, is fluttering attached to a bulldozer that crushes your house, that’s a messed up use of symbols. Symbols are everywhere and they are used and misused all the time. 
 						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="interview1">KH: Is there a productive way of using metaphor and symbol? </span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						BK: They both sustain lives and sustain people’s imagination and, of course, imagination is crucial, because I think it’s the imagination of the colonized and occupied people that really keeps them living against all odds. It allows the people to question; what if there was no watchtower? What happens if I do get justice? How do I get around this checkpoint? What if co-existence? That’s all imagination. It’s all crucial. 
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="interview1">KH: Metaphor, symbols and imagination are also tools that artists use—how do you think artists can play a significant role in the conflict or social movements in general?  </span> 
						<br>
						<br>
						BK: There’s tragic and inspiring art language, like poetry from Mahmoud Darwish and puns and jokes. Everyone tells jokes and plays with tongue twisters. Lots of rappers now are just messing with the words of occupation and daily life. That’s what I think art is; those jokes and tongue twisters. The role of the artists is to tell our old stories in new ways so they don’t get stagnant. To reuse symbols and not let them become stagnant. Posing questions and just making things that are inspiring. I don’t think it’s the artist’s role to answer the questions, people put all that pressure on artists, like what’s the solution, what do you propose? I think artists need to be aligned with a left-wing progressive political movement.

						°Introduction°
					</h1>
					<p>
						I was approached by Besan Khamis late in November 2015 to participate in this publication. Prior to this project, conversations and debates about the Palestinian fight for independence with both Besan and his family brought to light the necessity of my practice to start becoming more politically and socially conscious. It became clear to me, that the way in which I achieved a certain level of self definition, has come from a deeply rooted concern for ethics and its application. As I move into a working space that exists in relation to larger systems of power, it is becoming more important to shape my practice in relation to this concern and its implication on my own state of being. 
						<br>
						<br>
						I’m a first generation American, the son of parents who both came from India to pursue higher education. My father was the first and only member of his family to leave the country at the time. Because of this, I’ve always felt the necessity to be very careful in what I say and who I say it to. Our position, both socially and politically, after my parents were settled in America, was seen as something very fragile, or at least, that is the impression that I have been left with. As a result, my work has taken a primary interest in formal experimentation. This is a place of safety for me, rules broken in the realm of the abstract (imagery) have no bearing on what we define as concrete, what we see doesn’t necessarily have to corelate to what we experience and behind this mask is where I take shelter.
						<br>
						<br>
						Images included in this project were generated with the help of a computer program I wrote early on in the project. The program, titled “Image Outliner,” is a small image editor written in a programming language called Python, and was originally meant to replace my reliance on illustrator’s live trace function. The script also allows batch editing and conversion which greatly expedites my production process. Image Outliner takes an inputted image(s) <span class="mono">(fig. 1)</span> and retrieves the RGB value of each pixel that makes up the image. When the script first starts, it asks the user to set a range of values (a number between 0-255) for the program to check for. If the pixel matches the user-defined parameters it changes the pixel to black, otherwise it sets the pixel value to white <span class="mono">(fig. 2)</span>. The script then loops through each pixel of the newly generated image <span class="mono">(fig. 2)</span> to see if they are black and, if they are, checks to see if they have a white pixel adjacent to them (which would indicate that this pixel is an edge pixel). If the pixel meets the aforementioned parameters, It is kept black, if not, the pixel is changed to white <span class="mono">(fig 3.)</span>

						The content below borrows its form, loosely, from that of a play, or physical performance, with sections subdivided into different “acts.” All of the writing was initially generated over a one week period while I was living at my parents house in Albuquerque, New Mexico. The writing was developed alongside intermittent conversations over facetime with Besan that would usually be in response to, or later inform, the writing from the previous or for the next day. The text as it exists now feels as if it begins and ends in transition, ideas were loosely pursued and expanded upon based on impulse. Even now, writing this introduction, I find there to be many problems in my logic (many gaps in its transcription as well), coming from either ignorance and/or arrogance. However, I do feel comfortable leaving this as a document to record and archive my thoughts on the subject at this point in time.

							ASSUMPTIONS (Automation):
						</span>

					</h1>

					<p>
						<span class="bold">· In application:</span> (1) The process of automation can be applied to the manipulation of data in digital space. And, (2) the process of automation can be applied through the introduction of robotic/mechanized hardware to create some sort of change in physical space.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">· There is a necessity for automation in the pursuit of symbolic abstraction.</span> We need to reclaim symbolic space from commodification. Our visual language is a form of social currency, a small reflection of our capacity for self-determination i.e. do we have control over what we see while in public space? There is a necessity for the of democratization of visual space.
						<br>
						<br> 
						<span class="bold">· A mark’s significance can become apparent if it is able to be quantified or replicated i.e. computers construct images through purely numerical data.</span> Each image is composed of a matrix of data points storing color values for each pixel that makes up the final image. Numerical abstraction presupposes a more concrete end, given that concept is being abstracted to numerical quantities that have more concrete physical representations vs. just keeping an idea in a purely theoretical space.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">· The process of automation inherently aids in the speed of production.</span> One of the main advantages of working in a digital space is the ability to automate repeatable actions. While I do believe the human hand, thought, or expression can never be truly replicated, it’s important to question the limits of our capacity for production.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">· The process of automation comes with the possibility of reproduction and iteration.</span> To distill an idea down to a logical series of instructions gives a process the ability to be reproduced by individuals outside the initial production phase: the sharing of an idea will potentially be more clear.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">· Dynamic (or responsive) automation allows for the artist to become cognizant of the relationship that she/he has with the medium, implying that the practice of art making is a two (or more) sided conversation between what is being made and the maker.</span> This relationship contains many metaphorical qualities that may be exploited given the specific intentions of the artist.

							Abstraction/Freedom...  The Reach

						<span class="bold">
							1. Shift: Shift reality slightly, into a realm of metaphor and the impossible.
							<br>
							<br> 
							2. *A fragile opening: This shift to the imaginary leaves a fragile opening between reality and fantasy.
							<br>
							<br>
							3. Reach: reach inside, grasp freedom.
							<br>
							<br> 
							*The Fragile Opening (Existing in the Eyelash Moment)
						</span>
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">Eyes open:</span> With eyes open we can take what we see around us to be our concrete reality, however absurd our reality may be.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">Eyes closed:</span> Strands of light + color, faces + figures float past. Our surreal--or at least the surface of our surreal.
						<br>
						<br>
						<span class="bold">Blink:</span> Eyelash Moment.
						<br>
						<br>
						When we blink, for an instant, the concrete reality is obfuscated. But our eyes are not closed. Our eyelashes collide and create a haze, wherein those phosphenes of light, color, form (free shapes) are infused with the forms of our daily life. Reality is refreshed.
